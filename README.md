# tic-tac-toe

This is a very simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe in c++. I'm learning c++ because I have decided it's cool. The code here is probably a bit rubbish as it's the first bit of software I have made with c++.

It features a simple text based interface and some prompts to let you enter your move. It has some simple edge case detection and can spot when someone has won.

```
   A     B     C 
      |     |     
1  -  |  -  |  -  
 _____|_____|_____
      |     |     
2  -  |  -  |  -  
 _____|_____|_____
      |     |     
3  -  |  -  |  -  
      |     |     
It's 0 to move. Where would you like to go?
```

## Getting started
